POSSIBLE:
	* --needed ?

0.4.21:
	* don't print notice when installed from repos ("weird... nothing to
	  intstall")
0.4.20:
	* allow installing packages from repos (again... accidently deleted it)
0.4.19:
	* recoded most of it
	* changed function and variable names
	* batch friendly (install: view all at beginning, compile, install)
	* check for new depends on update
	* when using sudo, run sudo -v ever blah seconds
	* noconfirm on install, since you already confirmed it
	* improved bash
		* removed excess code to append to an array
		* removed excess code to send array to function
		* fixed local variable issues
		* simplified [[ ]] and (( )) logic
	* added '--compressed' to curl
	* made single function for most curl-ness
	* Probably introduced a bunch of new bugs... ugh
0.4.18:
	* changed a few more [[ 1 ]] && [[ 2 ]] to [[ 1 && 2 ]]
	* fixed version_cmp -- 0.6.1-1 is newer than 0.6.0_rc7-1 (which it
	  previously saw as 0.6.07) and 0.6.1 is newer than 0.6.01
	* trashed version_cmp (still available in git), uses vercmp
	  (which is provided by pacman...)
	* changed some if statements to ${var1:-otherwise}
	* made some variables local 
	* removed some unnecessary cats
	* rearranged some conditions to speed up aur_find_updates
0.4.17:
	* removed some grep ... &>/dev/null or 2>/dev/null; use -s and -q
	* allow ~/.config/spinach/config for defaults
	* added --max, --tmp, and --edit options
	* all options are --option, all operations are -operation
	* only one operation per spinach run, multiple packages allowed
	  (a more standard way of doing things)
	* added a little help funcion back in... it's only a few lines
	* got rid of weird SPINTMPDIR and MAXTHREADS variables, made them
	  options
	* switched [ blah ] to [[ blah ]] and [ blah -gt 0 ] to (( blah > 0 ))
	* added --nossl, --nocol, --norep options
	* sort search results since it is normally expected to be (and since
	  it doesn't display as it downloads it anyway)
0.4.16:
	* when a pkgbuild depends on a program in a repo and you don't have
	  it, it will now not say "Not Found: blah"
0.4.15:
	* fixed seg fault when installing 'pngcrush'
0.4.14:
	* simplified string comparison logic [[ "a" > "b" ]] in version_cmp
	* version_cmp will now work like specified in `man pacman`
0.4.13:
	* make pacman_run return the value pacman returned
0.4.12:
	* only update packages that are older... don't list ones that
	  are newer; added version_cmp function
	* use nullglob during pacman install
0.4.11:
	* more newline fixes (one was when nothing was returned for
	  a search)
0.4.1:
	* added xargs command in again to fix line return issues
0.4.0:
	* fixed problem when search results includes package that has a '}' in
	  the version number (which I think is bad to begin with... but anyway)
	* added newline to search results with -rep specified
	* print not found when search result is  ^{"type":"error"
	* cd into build directory after every update (otherwise you'll have a
	  lot of "Not Saved" messages if you update more than one package)
0.3.99:
	* improved code
	  * changed 'su -c blah' to 'su root -c blah'
	  * changed some [[ to ((
	  * removed all uses of xargs
	  * changed some *blah to ./*blah
	  * changed a lot of 'echo blah | cmd' to 'cmd <<< blah'
	* decreased thread wait time from 0.1 to 0.05
	* improved speed of aur_download_deps when a lot of depends
	  are specified (only run pacman once)
0.3.98:
	* made for looping over threads use ${!q[@]} for array instead
	  of $(seq 0 $((${#q[@]}-1)))
0.3.97:
	* added MAXTHREADS to set max number (+1) of curl instances
	* made SSL be multithreaded also (above fixed speed issue)
0.3.96:
	* sort the multithreaded curl results; otherwise they
	  will be in a random order if -ssl isn't specified
	* added -sq operation for a quiet search (returns nothing
	  if no results, and doesn't print descriptions) which
	  allows regex searches
0.3.95:
	* checks for updates with multiple processes when not using
	  the SSL option since, in my testing, multiple curl processes
	  using SSL took the same time as without multiple processes
	  yet it increased the amount CPU usage
0.3.94:
	* moved help to man page
0.3.93:
	* removed aur_open... since it wasn't defined; this resulted
	  in an unusable bash script
0.3.92:
	* removed -r option on makepkg since it would uninstall all
	  the depends and then install them seconds later
	* when --version specified, exit after printing it
0.3.91:
	* fixed infinite install after first time trying again
	* when downloading print "(installed)" if installed
	* added more color to listing updates
0.3.9:
	* fixed security problem with commands possibly being
	  executed as root when installing with su (a package
	  file named ';echo cow;.pkg.tar.xz')
	* when error running su/sudo, run again (after asking
	  the user)
	* fixed problem where /spinach couldn't be created since
	  it didn't default to /tmp
0.3.8:
	* changed EDITOR defaults; moved emacs before vi
	* install depends as depends when running the installer
	* fixed when aur_message wouldn't print entire message
	* added SPINTMPDIR support; otherwise any `mktemp` or any
	  other commands would create temporary files in the TMPDIR
	  directory (now checks $SPINTMPDIR, $TMPDIR, and defaults
	  to /tmp)
0.3.7:
	* user agent is now just "Spinach" (decreases the number
	  of user agents used)
	* first check if the dep is satisfied (pacman -T) when
	  doing dep checks
	* fixed bugs with aur_download_deps where it wouldn't find
	  some depends
	* when using aur_message, must specify type (e.g. Error)
	* changed "Does not exist" to "Missing;" more concise
	* rearranged and renamed functions to more-closely
	  follow the help file
0.3.6:
	* when installing with repo support (-rep) check if
	  installing a pacman group
	* made "not found" messages print location (if applies)
0.3.5:
	* fixed installing applications without sudo installed
	* when installing depends, install the parent package
	* fixed creating spinach/{build,cache} when deleted
0.3.4:
	* when updating ask "View ...?" before downloading,
	  thus saving bandwidth
	* changed "View ...?" to "Update ...?" since it makes
	  more sense
	* moved tmp from $TMPDIR/aur_spinach to $TMPDIR/spinach
	* moved cache to spinach/cache and build directory
	  to spinach/build
	* added aur_message() to get rid of a lot of printf and
	  echo statements
0.3.3:
	* move created packages during install (-i) into
	  aur_spinach/spinach_cache (so, for example, when
	  sudo times out, you don't have to rebuild)
0.3.2:
	* removed aur_spinach_update tmp; everything is done in
	  aur_spinach
	* added update.lock so you can't update twice at the
	  same time
	* added repo (-rep) support for printing info (-p)
	* when downloading updates, print version changes
	* use printf instead of multiple echo's in places
0.3.1:
	* added repo support to installer with -rep option (if
	  it is in repo, install with pacman; otherwise use AUR)
	* use aur_spinach tmp for install; use aur_spinach_update
	  for update, so you can install multiple programs
	  at the same time
0.3.0:
	* reorganized help message
	* added EDITOR defaults
	* combined yes/no code since it's used more than once
	* yes/no code forces the user to answer either y or n
	* fixed ^C (trap) bugs
	* removed extra space when printing info for non-existant
	  package without color support
	* made -i and -u use aur_spinach tmp directory instead of
	  random one for each run (helps if using ccache)
	* remove aur_spinach only if blank, otherwise error
0.2.9:
	* changed options/operations names around to allow install
	  to be -i and auto upgrade to be -u
0.2.8:
	* added -di for installing packages
	* combined some -di and -a code into aur_run_install()
0.2.7:
	* added -a for automatic upgrade (download in tmp, edit files,
	  run makepkg, remove tmp files)
0.2.6:
	* changed curl option -O to -o to output to the right file
0.2.5:
	* added repo support (-rep) for searching and decided that
	  it's not worth having a pacman wrapper for operations
	  like download and update (too much code and not the
	  intention of this script)
0.2.4:
	* majorly increased speed of aur_update()
0.2.3:
	* improved speed of aur_download()
...
0.1.0:
	* initial release
